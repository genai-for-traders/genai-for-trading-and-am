    "# Customizing Your LLM to Your Needs: Fine-Tuning Llama 3.1 Using QLoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practical use case of how we can adapt an LLM to our own needs, we will simulate a situation where we have access to an LLM and want to adapt it to better respond to some private documentation, specifically, answering domain-specific questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Chapter 10 of the book, one way to customize an LLM to work with your own data is through fine-tuning, also known as post-training.  In this notebook, as a practical example, we will **fine-tune Meta’s Llama 3.1** to answer **finance-related questions**!\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about fine-tuning and efficient inference, we recommend reviewing Chapter 10.  If needed, for implementation details, we invite you to revisit the previous tutorials on Hugging Face, dataset handling, and model fine-tuning before on the book repository diving into this notebook.\n"

    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use [Llama 3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/) with 8 billion parameters, commonly referred to as Llama 3.1 8B. The choice of model size is mainly based on the free computational resources available on Google Colab for experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, working with thei model in half precision (float16) would require about 16GB of VRAM, which matches the maximum available memory in Colab at the time of writing. If we try to fine-tune the model with this setup, it would likely result in out-of-memory  errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we will use a quantized 4-bit precision version of the Llama 3.1 8B model, published by [unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit). Quantization reduces the model size and memory requirements significantly, allowing us to fine-tune the LLM with fewer resources.\n",

      "The car deal makes money 3 ways. If you pay in one lump payment. If the payment is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, they make a profit. They loan you the money. You make payments over months or years, if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, plus their finance expenses they make money. Of course the money takes years to come in, or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount. You trade in a car and they sell it at a profit. Of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car... They or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance, or you buy lots of expensive dealer options. Some dealers wave two deals in front of you: get a 0% interest loan. These tend to be shorter 12 months vs 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter length makes it harder for many to afford. If you can't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget. pay cash and get a rebate. If you take the rebate you can't get the 0% loan. If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.<|eot_id|> \n",

      "Negative Balance from Automatic Options Exercise. What to do?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",
      "\n",
      "Automatic exercisions can be extremely risky, and the closer to the money the options are, the riskier their exercisions are. It is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk.  Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, it's solvency policy is already risky. Regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability, the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible. If there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan, the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan. Since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase, the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary. Accounts after exercise For deep in the money exercised options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection.  First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed.  Since it's deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one's liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade.  If the positions are closed on any business day after the exercision, there will be no penalty or restriction. Cash option accounts While this is possible, many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account, and the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement seems ambiguous, but their options trading page implies the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable, so any margin will trigger a margin call.  If the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100%. Equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisor's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any deficit is financed with debt, thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would. To preempt a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this will be more expensive, and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud.  The least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery.<|eot_id|> \n",

    "\n",
    "Our model has **8 billion parameters**, and fine-tuning all of them would be extremely slow, memory-intensive, and it comes with risk of catastrophic forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we use **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation), a technique that allows us to fine-tune only a small number of additional parameters on top of the original model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA works by injecting small trainable \"adapters\" into certain parts of the model (such as the attention layers). This makes fine-tuning much faster, requires far less memory, and lets us achieve high-quality results without needing to update billions of parameters. To learn more about Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), refer to Chapter 10 of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step, we will set up LoRA for our Llama 3.1 model."
